## The pieces

| Type | Is |
|---|---|
| `Tool` | A description for the model: `name`, `description`, `input_schema` (JSON Schema) |
| `ToolCall` | A call the model made: `id`, `name`, and `arguments` as the raw JSON string it wrote |
| `ToolResult` | The answer to one call: `call_id`, `content` (a string), and `is_error` for a failed call |
| `Toolbox` | A trait: anything that lists tools and answers calls |
| `Tools` | A `Toolbox` that is a plain registry of handlers |

A request takes descriptions (`Request::tool`, `Request::tools`). Answering
calls stays with the toolbox. Nothing runs on its own: svir executes only
handlers the caller registered, and only when the caller's loop asks.

## The `Tools` registry

```rust
use serde::Deserialize;
use serde_json::json;
use svir::prelude::*;

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct Lookup {
    id: u64,
}

fn tools() -> Tools {
    let lookup = Tool::new("lookup", "Find an order by its number.").schema(json!({
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {"id": {"type": "integer", "description": "The order number"}},
        "required": ["id"]
    }));
    // A tool that takes no arguments needs no schema.
    let now = Tool::new("now", "The current time, UTC.");

    Tools::new()
        .add_tool(lookup, |args: Lookup| async move { format!("order {} is shipped", args.id) })
        .add_tool(now, |_: serde_json::Value| async { "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z" })
}
```

* `add_tool(tool, handler)` takes `self` and returns it; registration is a
  chain.
* A handler is an async closure or function of **one** argument: a type that
  deserializes from the JSON object the model wrote. Several parameters go
  into one struct.
* **Deserializing is the validation.** Arguments that do not fit the type
  never reach the handler: the model gets a failed result,
  `invalid arguments: ...`, and can try again. There is no separate JSON Schema validator, so a rule
  the type does not express (a range, a pattern) is checked in the handler.
* The schema is for the model and the type is for the handler. Keep them in
  agreement, or derive one from the other (below).
* A tool added under a name already registered replaces the earlier one.
* State goes into the closure: clone an `Arc` into it and again into the
  `async move` block.

## Schemas from types

With svir's `schemars` feature, `Tools::add` derives the schema from the
argument type, doc comments included.

<!-- snippet: features="schemars" -->
```rust
use schemars::JsonSchema;
use serde::Deserialize;
use svir::prelude::*;

#[derive(Deserialize, JsonSchema)]
struct Convert {
    /// The amount to convert.
    amount: f64,
    /// The currency to convert from, as a three-letter code.
    from: String,
    /// The currency to convert to, as a three-letter code.
    to: String,
}

async fn convert(args: Convert) -> String {
    format!("{} {} is about {} {}", args.amount, args.from, args.amount, args.to)
}

fn tools() -> Tools {
    Tools::new().add("convert", "Convert an amount between currencies.", convert)
}
```

The caller's crate needs `schemars = "1"` for the derive. `add` and
`add_tool` can be mixed in one registry.

## What a handler returns

| Return type | The model receives |
|---|---|
| `String`, `&str` | The text |
| `serde_json::Value` | The value written as JSON |
| `Result<T, E>` with `E: Display` | `T` as above, or a failed result whose content is `E` |

A failure is a result too: `ToolResult::error(call_id, message)`, with
`is_error` set and the message, nothing added, as its content. The same goes
for an unknown tool name and for invalid arguments. So return `Err` with a
message worth reading, not a panic: the model reads it and can correct
itself.

Chat Completions has no field that marks a failed call, so the encoder sends
`error: ` before the content: the model reads `error: no weather station in
Atlantis`. Two consequences:

* Do not write the prefix by hand. `ToolResult::error(id, "error: ...")`
  sends it twice; `ToolResult::new(id, "error: ...")` reads as a failure to
  the model but not to code that tests `is_error`.
* Code that inspects a result from `Tools` tests `result.is_error`, not
  `content.starts_with("error:")`. Before 0.1.4 the prefix was in `content`.

Anything else is turned into one of these by the handler: serialize a struct
with `serde_json::to_value`, or format it.

## The loop

```rust
use svir::prelude::*;

/// A model that keeps calling tools is stopped after this many answers.
const TURNS: usize = 8;

async fn run(client: &Client, tools: &Tools, mut request: Request) -> Result<Completion, Error> {
    for _ in 0..TURNS {
        let done = client.complete(&request).await?;
        if done.calls.is_empty() {
            return Ok(done);
        }

        let results = tools.call_all(&done.calls).await;
        request = request.assistant(done).tool_results(results);
    }

    Err(Error::new(ErrorKind::Unsupported).with_detail("the model kept calling tools"))
}
```

The request passed in already carries the tools (`Request::tools(&tools)`)
and the user's message. Four things keep the loop correct:

* **The assistant turn goes back first, then the results.**
  `request.assistant(done)` carries the calls and their IDs; each result
  answers one ID. Leave either out and the model sees results for calls it
  never made.
* **Every call gets a result.** A model can ask for several tools at once;
  `call_all` answers them all, in order.
* **Test `calls`, not `finish`.** An answer cut off by the output limit is
  `FinishReason::Length` with no calls, and ends the loop as an answer.
* **The bound is yours.** So is what happens at the bound.

`call_all` runs the handlers one after another. For handlers that are slow
and independent, call `tools.call(call)` for each and join the futures; keep
the results in the order of the calls.

## The loop, streamed

Show text and calls as they arrive; run the calls only from the completion.

```rust
use svir::prelude::*;

async fn turn(client: &Client, request: &Request) -> Result<Completion, Error> {
    let mut stream = client.stream(request).await?;

    while let Some(event) = stream.next().await {
        match event? {
            Event::Text(piece) => print!("{piece}"),
            // A piece of a call: a name once, then fragments of the arguments.
            Event::ToolCallDelta(piece) => {
                if let Some(name) = piece.name {
                    eprint!("\ncalling {name} ");
                }
                eprint!("{}", piece.arguments);
            }
            Event::Completed(done) => return Ok(done),
            _ => {}
        }
    }

    Err(Error::new(ErrorKind::TruncatedStream))
}
```

`ToolCallDelta::index` tells pieces of different calls apart; they can
interleave. The fragments of `arguments` are not valid JSON until joined, and
joining them is the decoder's work: use `Completion::calls`.

## Requiring or forbidding a call

The model decides by default. `Request::tool_choice` (svir 0.1.5) decides
instead:

| `ToolChoice` | The model | Sent as |
|---|---|---|
| `Auto` | Decides. The default | Nothing |
| `None` | May not call a tool | `"none"`; nothing when the request offers no tools |
| `Required` | Must call at least one of the tools offered | `"required"` |
| `ToolChoice::tool(name)` | Must call this tool, which the request offers | `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": ...}}` |

```rust
use serde_json::json;
use svir::prelude::*;

fn classify(ticket: &str) -> Request {
    let label = Tool::new("label", "Label a support ticket by its topic.").schema(json!({
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {"topic": {"type": "string", "enum": ["billing", "bug", "other"]}},
        "required": ["topic"]
    }));

    Request::new("qwen3-27b")
        .tool(label)
        // The answer is a call of `label`, not prose.
        .tool_choice(ToolChoice::tool("label"))
        .user(ticket)
}
```

* **A call that cannot be made fails before anything is sent**, with
  `ErrorKind::Unsupported`: `Required` on a request with no tools ("a tool
  call is required, and the request offers no tools"), or a named tool the
  request does not offer ("a call is required of a tool the request does not
  offer").
* **Never dropped.** The compatibility retry keeps the choice; a server that
  does not take it fails the request with `Unsupported` and its message.
  LM Studio rejects a named tool with a 400; offer that one tool and use
  `Required`.
* **Not checked.** A server may take the choice and not keep it: LM Studio
  accepts `Required` and can answer with text and no call. Test
  `done.calls`, as the loop does; never assume the call is there.
* **The choice stays on the request.** In a loop, a model required to call a
  tool on every turn never answers. Once it has called, set it back:
  `request.assistant(done).tool_results(results).tool_choice(ToolChoice::Auto)`.
* `None` keeps the tools in the request and asks for an answer without a
  call: one way to end a loop at its bound.
* For an answer as JSON, `response_format` with a `Schema` is the direct
  route; a required tool call is the route on a server without structured
  output. See `requests.md`.

## A toolbox of one's own

Tools that share state, or that come from somewhere else (another process, a
plugin system), implement `Toolbox` directly.

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;

use serde::Deserialize;
use serde_json::json;
use svir::prelude::*;

#[derive(Default)]
struct Notes {
    kept: Mutex<Vec<String>>,
}

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct Note {
    text: String,
}

impl Toolbox for Notes {
    fn tools(&self) -> Vec<Tool> {
        let note = Tool::new("note", "Keep a note for later.").schema(json!({
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {"text": {"type": "string"}},
            "required": ["text"]
        }));
        let notes = Tool::new("notes", "Read back every note kept so far.");

        vec![note, notes]
    }

    async fn call(&self, call: &ToolCall) -> ToolResult {
        let mut kept = self.kept.lock().unwrap_or_else(|poisoned| poisoned.into_inner());

        let answer = match call.name.as_str() {
            "note" => match call.parse::<Note>() {
                Ok(note) => {
                    kept.push(note.text);
                    Ok("kept".to_owned())
                }
                Err(error) => Err(format!("invalid arguments: {error}")),
            },
            "notes" => Ok(kept.join("\n")),
            other => Err(format!("no tool named {other}")),
        };

        // A failure is a result too: the model reads it and can try again.
        match answer {
            Ok(content) => ToolResult::new(&call.id, content),
            Err(message) => ToolResult::error(&call.id, message),
        }
    }
}
```

* `call` returns a `ToolResult`, never an error: what went wrong is a
  `ToolResult::error` for the model.
* The future `call` returns must be `Send`. A `std::sync::MutexGuard` held
  across an `.await` breaks that; take the lock after the awaits, or use an
  async lock.
* `call_all` comes with the trait, and `Request::tools(&notes)` works for any
  `Toolbox`.

## Without a registry

`ToolCall::parse::<T>()` deserializes the arguments for code that dispatches
by hand:

```rust
use serde::Deserialize;
use svir::prelude::*;

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct Lookup {
    id: u64,
}

fn answer(call: &ToolCall) -> ToolResult {
    match call.parse::<Lookup>() {
        Ok(args) => ToolResult::new(&call.id, format!("order {} is shipped", args.id)),
        Err(error) => ToolResult::error(&call.id, format!("invalid arguments: {error}")),
    }
}
```

A model that calls a tool with no arguments may send an empty string, which
is not JSON. `Tools` reads it as `{}`; hand-written dispatch has to allow
for it.

## What svir does not do

* **No `#[tool]` macro.** A tool is a `Tool` and a handler.
* **No MCP.** svir has no MCP client. Tools of an MCP server reach a model
  through a bridge that implements `Toolbox` on the MCP side.
* **No tool runs by itself.** Arguments come from a model and are data.
  Whether a call is allowed (a path, a command, an amount) is for the handler
  to check.
